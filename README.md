Step 1: Cloning and Building Darknet
Step 2: Download pre-trained YOLOv4 weights that has been trained already on the coco dataset which has 80 classes that it can predict.
Step 3: Define Helper Functions These three functions are helper functions that will allow you to show the image in your Colab Notebook after running your detections, as well as upload and download images to and from your Cloud VM.
Step 4: You now have your Custom YOLOv4 Datasets! Moving Your Custom Datasets Into Your Cloud VM
